Installation Guide
==================

Installation
------------

Assuming you have pip installed:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install klink

That's it.

Usage
-----

In your docs' **conf.py** file, add the following:

.. code:: python

    import klink

    html_theme = 'klink'
    html_theme_path [klink.get_html_theme_path()]
    html_theme_options = {
        'github': 'yourname/yourrepo',
        'analytics_id': 'UA-your-number-here',
        'logo': 'logo.png'
    }

Klink also comes with a useful helper function that allows you to integrate an
IPython Notebook into a .rst file. It basically converts the Notebook to .rst
and copies the static data (images, etc) to your _static dir. 

If you have IPython Notebooks that you would like to integrate, use the
following code to your **conf.py**:

.. code:: python

    klink.convert_notebooks()

Once the conversion is done, you will have a .rst file with the same name as
each one of your notebooks.

.. note::

    Place your notebooks in your docs' source dir.

Now all you have to do is use the **include** command to insert them into your
docs.
